## Okay let's blog

@adriantwarog told me in his article "[Programmers That Don't Blog Should Start Right Now](https://adriantwarog.com/programmers-that-dont-blog-should-start-right-now)"  to start blogging because every developer should do it. Maybe not all, but I agree that every developer I know who blogs is a good developer. And since I want to call myself a good developer too, here we go today.
What content do I want to publish? I have a long list of ideas. I've been carrying those around in front of me for years. Many of the topics are now outdated. Therefore, I have a new approach. I'm actually going to use it like a logbook. Like the captain on the Enterprise, I say "Engage."
