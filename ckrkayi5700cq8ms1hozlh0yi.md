## Job with a daily dose of goose bumps



What I love about my job is that I can listen to my favourite music at any time. I bought extra over-ear headphones because I want to wear them as long as possible without pain. In what other job would I have goose bumps early in the morning?
This morning from a cover of a song by *Heinz Rudolf Kunze*. Even if you don't understand the lyrics, you'll get goosebumps anyway, didn't you? Who would have thought that German can sound so tender. So turn on your headphones and enjoy 🙂+🎧️= 🦆
