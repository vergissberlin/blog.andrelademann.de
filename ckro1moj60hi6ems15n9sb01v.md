## VS Code includes GitHub's CoPilot  and I just love it!


The year is 2021, and  [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk)  is so  [scared about AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdTTeR4TyMc) and its danger to humanity that he is pushing to build [big rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship) ðŸš€ to land on Mars as soon as possible. And he has to know it, he is one of the investors in *OpenAI*, a company (largely owned by Microsoft) that has developed an AI program called [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3).
This AI is now used by GitHub in Microsoft's editor *Visual Studio Code* to write code, based on comments we write in the document.
To this day, most programmers do not use this technology to write their code. Everything is *handwritten* (more or less, or copied from somewhere on the net). I imagine that in the near future, we will smile about this as much as about programmers with [real bugs](https://blog.patracompany.com/the-history-of-the-computer-bug) and [punch cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card). ðŸ¤£

## So, why I am so excited?

I can imagine myself laughing at myself one day when I read this in the distant future, or I cry and say to my granddaughter "We used to write code by hand, and it was legible, clear and beautiful, not like what the AI does today."

When I tried AI for the first time, I was so amazed! One line after the other filled with meaningful content (aka code), and I just pressed the tab key, tab key, tab key â€¦

**Even a chicken can program in that way!**

If CoPilot where allowed to bring the sentence **"From today's perspective, [â€¦]"** to an end, it would write:

```python
we can see the AI as a tool that can help us write code 
that is more readable, more maintainable, and more efficient. 
```

**Oh shit wait!** It really completed the ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤– `sentence, and it is more readable, more maintainable, and more efficient!` ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–

**STOP!! Go away! Arrrrgghhh!**
