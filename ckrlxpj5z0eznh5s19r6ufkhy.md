## DRY üç∏Ô∏è ‚Äì design pattern

## Excuses to do it

- "It's another project. I don't know much about it. Don't wanna break something, so I just copied it."
- "I have not time, maybe later ‚Ä¶"
- "Maybe later on, I want to have something different in each function/template/class, so it's better to copy it."


## Advantages - to keep it DRY

- If you have to change something later on, you may have to do it twice (or even more times) to achieve your goal. So it is easier to maintain.
- Less code - is better code.  Just remember, if you copy something, you must copy the tests accordingly! You do test, don't you?



## Ways to take care about without even think about it

**Automatization** is the key. Not matter which language do you use in your current project, there is a _copy past detector_ out there. There are some for specific languages:

- JavaScript  [jscpd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jscpd) 
- PHP  [phpcpd](https://phpqa.io/projects/phpcpd.html) 

‚Ä¶ and some with cross language support like  [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/)  or  [Basta](https://github.com/kucherenko/basta).


### Usage

Easy to install and simple to use. You can even export machine-readable reports to show the results in a graph over time, for example. In my case, I used XML for my C++ report, which is compatible with good old Jenkins.

```bash
./run.sh cpd --files /path/to/source --language cpp --format xml
```

## Summary


![Dry not shaken](https://i.imgflip.com/5hn72r.jpg)

It doesn't take much effort to keep things dry. Just pull up your pens and take care of it! Automation with tests and copy-and-paste detectors can help to improve your code quality and the maintainability of your software.


## Questions

1. Are you try? Sometimes?
2. Do you inspect your code automatically?
3. If yes, which tool do you use to visualize the results?
